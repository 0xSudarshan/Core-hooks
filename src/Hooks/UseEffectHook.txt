useEffect renders each and evertime when there is a state update altho u can restrict to a rendering only 
to a particular state update by mentioning the dependencies to useEffect 
use Effect clean up function 
return =()=>{
    cleans up the code 

}
it avoids memory leaks and optimizes the code 
case: when  clicked  on a button ur component will mount(add nodes to your dom) and when clicked again it will unmount(remove the dom nodes) 
exxample : two components : root App component and child component in your child component we fetch the data where the api takes 10s seconds to fetch 
data in the interim u click on the button again and the component unmounts leading to memry leaks cuz the data fetched will try to 
add data to the unmounted component . so to inhibit this from happenning we use the clean up function
