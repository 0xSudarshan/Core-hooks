useEffect renders each and evertime when there is a state update altho u can restrict to a rendering only 
to a particular state update by mentioning the dependencies to useEffect 
use Effect clean up function 
return =()=>{
    cleans up the code 

}
it avoids memory leaks and optimizes the code 
exxample : two components : root App component
